(2,'do you have information about A1C','A1C is a blood test for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.It measures your average blood glucose, or blood sugar, level over the past 3 months.Doctors may use the A1C alone or in combination with other diabetes tests to make a diagnosis.They also use the A1C to see how well you are managing your diabetes.This test is different from the blood sugar checks that people with diabetes do every day. Your A1C test result is given in percentages. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been:      - A normal A1C level is below 5.7 percent    - Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4 percent.Having prediabetes is a risk factor for getting type 2 diabetes.People with prediabetes may need retests every year.      - Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5 percent      - If you have diabetes, you should have the A1C test at least twice a year.The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7. It may be different for you.Ask what your goal should be.If your A1C result is too high, you may need to change your diabetes care plan.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases'),
(3,'What is (are) Abdominal Pain ?',' Your abdomen extends from below your chest to your groin. Some people call it the stomach, but your abdomen contains many other important organs. Pain in the abdomen can come from any one of them. The pain may start somewhere else, such as your chest. Severe pain doesn&apos;t always mean a serious problem. Nor does mild pain mean a problem is not serious. Call your healthcare provider if mild pain lasts a week or more or if you have pain with other symptoms. Get medical help immediately if     -  You have abdominal pain that is sudden and sharp     - You also have pain in your chest, neck or shoulder     -  You are vomiting blood or have blood in your stool     -  Your abdomen is stiff, hard and tender to touch     - You cannot move your bowels, especially if you are also vomiting'),
(4,'What is (are) Abortion?',' An abortion is a procedure to end a pregnancy.  It uses medicine or surgery to remove the embryo or fetus and placenta from the uterus. The procedure is done by a licensed health care professional. The decision to end a pregnancy is very personal. If you are thinking of having an abortion, most healthcare providers advise counseling.'),
(5,'What is (are) Abscess ?','An abscess is a pocket of pus. You can get an abscess almost anywhere in your body. When an area of your body becomes infected, your body&apos;s immune system tries to fight the infection. White blood cells go to the infected area, collect within the damaged tissue, and cause inflammation. During this process, pus forms. Pus is a mixture of living and dead white blood cells, germs, and dead tissue.     Bacteria, viruses, parasites and swallowed objects can all lead to abscesses. Skin abscesses are easy to detect. They are red, raised and painful. Abscesses inside your body may not be obvious and can damage organs, including the brain, lungs and others. Treatments include drainage and antibiotics.'),
(6,'What is (are) Acne ?','Acne is a common skin disease that causes pimples. Pimples form when hair follicles under your skin clog up. Most pimples form on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. Anyone can get acne, but it is common in teenagers and young adults. It is not serious, but it can cause scars.    No one knows exactly what causes acne. Hormone changes, such as those during the teenage years and pregnancy, probably play a role. There are many myths about what causes acne. Chocolate and greasy foods are often blamed, but there is little evidence that foods have much effect on acne in most people. Another common myth is that dirty skin causes acne; however, blackheads and pimples are not caused by dirt. Stress doesn&apos;t cause acne, but stress can make it worse.    If you have acne       -  Clean your skin gently     -  Try not to touch your skin     -  Avoid the sun        Treatments for acne include medicines and creams.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases'),
(7,'What is (are) Acoustic Neuroma ?','An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. The tumor usually grows slowly. As it grows, it presses against the hearing and balance nerves. At first, you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include       -  Loss of hearing on one side     -  Ringing in ears    -  Dizziness and balance problems       The tumor can also eventually cause numbness or paralysis of the face. If it grows large enough, it can press against the brain, becoming life-threatening.    Acoustic neuroma can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to those of middle ear problems. Ear exams, hearing tests, and scans can show if you have it.    If the tumor stays small, you may only need to have it checked regularly. If you do need treatment, surgery and radiation are options.    If the tumors affect both hearing nerves, it is often because of a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis.    NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders'),
(8,'Do you have information about Acupuncture?','Summary : Acupuncture has been practiced in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years. Acupuncture involves stimulating specific points on the body. This is most often done by inserting thin needles through the skin, to cause a change in the physical functions of the body.    Research has shown that acupuncture reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery and chemotherapy. It can also relieve pain. Researchers don&apos;t fully understand how acupuncture works. It might aid the activity of your body&apos;s pain-killing chemicals. It also might affect how you release chemicals that regulate blood pressure and flow.

(9,'What is (are) Acute Bronchitis ?','Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, the airways that carry air to your lungs. It causes a cough that often brings up mucus. It can also cause shortness of breath, wheezing, a low fever, and chest tightness. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic.    Most cases of acute bronchitis get better within several days. But your cough can last for several weeks after the infection is gone.    The same viruses that cause colds and the flu often cause acute bronchitis. These viruses spread through the air when people cough, or though physical contact (for example, on unwashed hands). Being exposed to tobacco smoke, air pollution, dusts, vapors, and fumes can also cause acute bronchitis. Less often, bacteria can also cause acute bronchitis.    To diagnose acute bronchitis, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and listen to your breathing. You may also have other tests.    Treatments include rest, fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. A humidifier or steam can also help. You may need inhaled medicine to open your airways if you are wheezing. Antibiotics won&apos;t help if the cause is viral. You may get antibiotics if the cause is bacterial.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute'),
(10,'What is (are) Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ?','Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia, however, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work. In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), also called acute lymphoblastic leukemia, there are too many of specific types of white blood cells called lymphocytes or lymphoblasts. ALL is the most common type of cancer in children.    Possible risk factors for ALL include being male, being white, previous chemotherapy treatment, exposure to radiation, and for adults, being older than 70.    Symptoms of ALL include:       - Weakness or feeling tired    - Fever    - Easy bruising or bleeding    - Bleeding under the skin    - Shortness of breath    - Weight loss or loss of appetite    - Pain in the bones or stomach    - Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs    - Painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin       Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose ALL. Treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplants, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells. Once the leukemia is in remission, you need additional treatment to make sure that it does not come back.    NIH: National Cancer Institute'),
(11,'What is (are) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?','Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infection. Your blood cells form in your bone marrow. In leukemia, however, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells. These cells crowd out the healthy blood cells, making it hard for blood to do its work. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), there are too many of a specific type of white blood cell called a myeloblast.    AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. Possible risk factors include smoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation.     Symptoms of AML include:       - Fever    - Shortness of breath    - Easy bruising or bleeding    - Bleeding under the skin    - Weakness or feeling tired    - Weight loss or loss of appetite       Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow diagnose AML. Treatments include chemotherapy, other drugs, radiation therapy, stem cell transplants, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.

(12,'What is (are) Addison Disease ?','Your adrenal glands are just above your kidneys. The outside layer of these glands makes hormones that help your body respond to stress and regulate your blood pressure and water and salt balance. Addison disease happens if the adrenal glands don&apos;t make enough of these hormones.    A problem with your immune system usually causes Addison disease. The immune system mistakenly attacks your own tissues, damaging your adrenal glands. Other causes include infections and cancer.    Symptoms include       - Weight loss     - Muscle weakness     - Fatigue that gets worse over time     - Low blood pressure     - Patchy or dark skin        Lab tests can confirm that you have Addison disease. If you don&apos;t treat it, it can be fatal. You will need to take hormone pills for the rest of your life. If you have Addison disease, you should carry an emergency ID. It should say that you have the disease, list your medicines and say how much you need in an emergency.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases'),
(13,'What is (are) Adhesions ?','Adhesions are bands of scar-like tissue. Normally, internal tissues and organs have slippery surfaces so they can shift easily as the body moves. Adhesions cause tissues and organs to stick together. They might connect the loops of the intestines to each other, to nearby organs, or to the wall of the abdomen. They can pull sections of the intestines out of place. This may block food from passing through the intestine.    Adhesions can occur anywhere in the body. But they often form after surgery on the abdomen. Almost everyone who has surgery on the abdomen gets adhesions. Some adhesions don&apos;t cause any problems. But when they partly or completely block the intestines, they cause symptoms such as       - Severe abdominal pain or cramping    - Vomiting    - Bloating    - An inability to pass gas    - Constipation       Adhesions can sometimes cause infertility in women by preventing fertilized eggs from reaching the uterus.    No tests are available to detect adhesions. Doctors usually find them during surgery to diagnose other problems.    Some adhesions go away by themselves. If they partly block your intestines, a diet low in fiber can allow food to move easily through the affected area. If you have a complete intestinal obstruction, it is life threatening. You should get immediate medical attention and may need surgery.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases'),
(14,'What is (are) Adrenal Gland Cancer ?','Your adrenal, or suprarenal, glands are located on the top of each kidney. These glands produce hormones that you can&apos;t live without, including sex hormones and cortisol, which helps you respond to stress and has many other functions.    A number of disorders can affect the adrenal glands, including tumors. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren&apos;t cancer. Malignant ones are. Most adrenal gland tumors are benign. They usually do not cause symptoms and may not require treatment. Malignant adrenal gland cancers are uncommon.    Types of tumors include       - Adrenocortical carcinoma - cancer in the outer part of the gland    - Neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer    - Pheochromocytoma - a rare tumor that is usually benign       Symptoms depend on the type of cancer you have. Treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.'),
(15,'What is (are) Adrenal Gland Disorders ?','The adrenal glands are small glands located on top of each kidney. They produce hormones that you can&apos;t live without, including sex hormones and cortisol. Cortisol helps you respond to stress and has many other important functions.    With adrenal gland disorders, your glands make too much or not enough hormones. In Cushing&apos;s syndrome, there&apos;s too much cortisol, while with Addison&apos;s disease, there is too little. Some people are born unable to make enough cortisol.    Causes of adrenal gland disorders include       - Genetic mutations    - Tumors including pheochromocytomas    - Infections    - A problem in another gland, such as the pituitary, which helps to regulate the adrenal gland    - Certain medicines      Treatment depends on which problem you have. Surgery or medicines can treat many adrenal gland disorders.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'),
(16,'What is (are) After Surgery ?','After any operation, you&apos;ll have some side effects. There is usually some pain with surgery. There may also be swelling and soreness around the area that the surgeon cut. Your surgeon can tell you which side effects to expect.    There can also be complications. These are unplanned events linked to the operation. Some complications are infection, too much bleeding, reaction to anesthesia, or accidental injury. Some people have a greater risk of complications because of other medical conditions.    Your surgeon can tell you how you might feel and what you will be able to do - or not do - the first few days, weeks, or months after surgery. Some other questions to ask are       - How long you will be in the hospital    - What kind of supplies, equipment, and help you might need when you go home    - When you can go back to work    - When it is ok to start exercising again    - Are they any other restrictions in your activities       Following your surgeon&apos;s advice can help you recover as soon as possible.

(17,'Do you have information about Alcohol','For many people, moderate drinking is probably safe. It may even have health benefits, including reducing your risk of certain heart problems. For most women and for most people over 65, moderate drinking is no more than three drinks a day or seven drinks per week. For men under 65, it is no more than four drinks a day or 14 drinks per week.    Some people should not drink at all, including alcoholics, children, pregnant women, people taking certain medicines, and people with certain medical conditions. If you have questions about whether it is safe for you to drink, speak with your health care provider.    Anything more than moderate drinking can be risky. Heavy drinking can lead to alcoholism and alcohol abuse, as well as injuries, liver disease, heart disease, cancer, and other health problems. It can also cause problems at home, at work, and with friends.    NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism'),
(18,'What is (are) Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse ?','For most adults, moderate alcohol use is probably not harmful. However, about 18 million adults have an alcohol use disorder. This means that their drinking causes distress and harm. It includes alcoholism and alcohol abuse.    Alcoholism, or alcohol dependence, is a disease that causes       - Craving - a strong need to drink    - Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you&apos;ve started    - Physical dependence - withdrawal symptoms    - Tolerance - the need to drink more alcohol to feel the same effect       With alcohol abuse, you are not physically dependent, but you still have a serious problem. The drinking may cause problems at home, work, or school. It may cause you to put yourself in dangerous situations, or lead to legal or social problems.    Another common problem is binge drinking. It is drinking about five or more drinks in two hours for men. For women, it is about four or more drinks in two hours.    Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It can cause damage to the liver, brain, and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your baby. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide.    If you want to stop drinking, there is help. Start by talking to your health care provider. Treatment may include medicines, counseling, and support groups.    NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism'),
(19,'what is (are) allergy ?','An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Substances that often cause reactions are       - Pollen    - Dust mites    - Mold spores    - Pet dander    - Food    - Insect stings    - Medicines       Normally, your immune system fights germs. It is your body&apos;s defense system. In most allergic reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role.    Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening. Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include medicines, allergy shots, and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases'),

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein that protects the lungs. The liver makes it. If the AAT proteins aren&apos;t the right shape, they get stuck in the liver cells and can&apos;t reach the lungs.    Symptoms of AAT deficiency include       - Shortness of breath and wheezing    - Repeated lung infections    - Tiredness    - Rapid heartbeat upon standing    - Vision problems    - Weight loss       Some people have no symptoms and do not develop complications.    Blood tests and genetic tests can tell if you have it. If your lungs are affected, you may also have lung tests. Treatments include medicines, pulmonary rehab, and extra oxygen, if needed.

(25,'What is Asthma','Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing. During an asthma attack, the lining of the bronchial tubes (airways) swells, causing the airways to narrow, turn more sensitive to irritants in the environment, and thus reducing the flow of air into and out of the lungs. The causes of asthma are not completely understood.However, risk factors for developing asthma include inhaling asthma “triggers”, such as allergens (some common to all and some individualized), tobacco smoke and chemical irritants. Several patients with asthma may also have allergic rhinitis which is characterized by sneezing and “runny” nose. It can start at any age. About half of all people with asthma tend to have their first symptoms by the age of ten years, and many children with asthma have had their first asthma attack before the age of six. Asthma cannot be cured, but appropriate management can control the disorder and enable people to enjoy a good quality of life. '),

The pain from arthritis is due to inflammation that occurs around the joint, damaged joint due to daily wear and tear or disease, muscle strains caused by forceful movements against stiff painful joints and fatigue.'),
(27,'What is Airbag Eye Injury?','Airbag Eye Injury varying from minor abrasions to traumatic hyphaema and secondary glaucoma may result from automobile airbags. Airbags reduce the risk of injury and death from motor vehicle accident, however, injuries attributed to airbag use have been reported. There may be damage to virtually every structure of the eye and adnexa. Most injuries are self- limited and do not significantly affect vision, some result in severe visual loss. Damage to anterior structures of eye is commoner than injury to posterior segment. Posterior segment trauma is generally more visually devastating because of the involvement of optic nerve or retina.A closer look of the type of eye injuries showed a statistically significant increased risk of corneal abrasion for occupants exposed to airbag deployment. However, occupants from car accidents without airbag deployment sustained a greater number of severe eye injuries. Characteristics of car occupants and crashes, such as seat belt, contact lens, eyeglasses, crash velocity, age and height, are not significantly correlated with the risk of airbag- induced injury.Rising proportion of airbag- equipped cars as well as the increasing number of people electing for corrective vision surgery are the trends that may increase risk and severity of airbag- induced eye injury.Awareness of airbag associated eye injuries help in recognising these problems early and help in their management.'),
(28,'what is Anthrax?','Anthrax is an infectious zoonotic disease (could be transferred from animals to humans). It is primarily a disease of herbivorous animals particularly cattles sheep, goats, horses and mules. The disease naturally occurs among herbivorous animals through contaminated soil and feed; among omnivorous and carnivorous animals through contaminated meat, bone meals or other feeds; and among wild animals from feeding on anthrax infected carcasses. Infected animals shed the bacilli in terminal hemorrhage or spilt blood at death. Anthrax spores can persist in soil for many years.Humans almost invariably contract the natural disease directly or indirectly from animals or animal products.Anthrax is existed in many parts of the world, including Asia, southern Europe, sub-Sahelian Africa and parts of Australia. Anthrax also called Malignant pustule, Malignant oedema, Woolsorters disease, or Ragpickers disease Anthrax is enzootic (normally present in an area in animals) in southern India but is less frequent to absent in the northern Indian States. In the past years the anthrax cases have been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Karnataka.Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), National Centre for disease control (NCDC), Delhi, India reported 6 outbreaks of anthrax in India during the year 2014.Bioterrorism and Anthrax:Anthrax is considered an important biological warfare agent because:(i)    it is highly fatal and when transmitted through inhalation is almost always fatal,(ii)    anthrax spores can remain viable for several decades and can be easily produced in large quantities at a very low cost, and(iii)    it is easy to weaponize and disseminate anthrax as an odourless and invisible aerosol which can affect thousands of people at the same time.'),

It can affect anyone, although it is more common in people who live in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions.Amoebiasis is a common infection of the human gastro-intestinal tract.  Amoebiasis is more closely related to poor sanitation and socioeconomic status than to climate. It has worldwide distribution. It is a major health problem in China, South East and West Asia and Latin America, especially Mexico.Amoebiasis affects about 15% of Indian population. It has been reported throughout India.In addition to being a potentially lethal disease, invasive amoebiasis has important social and economic consequences. Temporarily incapacitating infections, which are frequent in adult males in the wage-earning age group, may require several weeks of hospitalization and 2-3 months for full recovery. Amoebiasis may cause clinical problems in persons with immunodeficiency, homosexuals and immigrants from certain tropical countries, and travellers.'),
(30,'what is Atherosclerosis?','Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside   arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to   heart and other parts of your body.Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to   organs and other parts of your body.Atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death.'),
(31,'What is Adult inclusion conjunctivitis or Paratrachoma','Adult inclusion conjunctivitis or Paratrachoma results due to infection by obligate intracellular bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D to K), which causes chronic follicular conjunctivitis (follicular conjunctivitis lasting for more than 16- 28 days). These organisms infect the epithelium of mucoid surfaces and were once identified as the trachoma-inclusion conjunctivitis agents (TRIC agents). These organisms can also infect a neonate during birth and may lead to neonatal conjunctivitis.Chlamydia trachomatis also includes the agents of classic trachoma (serotypes A, B, Ba and C). Lymphogranuloma venereum, a sexually transmitted infection, is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes L1 to L3) which infect tissues deeper to the epithelium.Adult inclusion conjunctivitis is transmitted sexually (oro-genital activities) or from hand-to-eye contact. Gonorrhoea is the most common co-infection associated with adult inclusion conjunctivitis. Rarely, adult inclusion conjunctivitis is transmitted through eye-to-eye contact (e.g. by sharing mascara).'),
(32,'what is Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis','Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a relatively uncommon, but potentially blinding ocular (eye) disease, which typically affects young people with atopic dermatitis.  AKC is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva which may have dramatic consequences for visual function.The incidence of atopic dermatitis is greatest in paediatric population. AKC may occur at any time after the onset of the associated dermatitis or other atopic condition, and is not necessarily correlated with exacerbations of these conditions. The initial presentation of ocular symptoms in AKC most commonly occurs in the second to third decade of life, with some patients presenting earlier or later (range varies from late teens to 50 years with peak age of incidence in people aged 30-50 years). Visually significant complications most frequently occur in the fourth to fifth decades, with more men affected than women. The condition then remains chronic for years, usually requiring lifelong treatment. An earlier onset of AKC carries the greatest risk for tear film abnormalities and greater ocular surface damage. Classically involved skin areas of atopic dermatitis are lateral neck folds, antecubital (in-front of the elbow) and popliteal (back of knee joint) fossae, but may involve other parts of body including eyelid.In the year 1952, Hogan described bilateral conjunctivitis occurring in patients with atopic dermatitis (coined the term atopic keratoconjunctivitis), which flared-up with worsening dermatitis. Patients notably showed chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis may evolve independent of dermatitis in some patients. Hogan’s criteria to aid in diagnosis is presence or history of eczematous dermatitis, a family history of atopic disease, associated allergies (asthma, hay fever), eosinophilia and a characteristic keratoconjunctivitis associated with exacerbations of dermatitis. His patients were notable for chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation.Atopic keratoconjunctivitis represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). The potential for corneal involvement and opacification increases significantly with the CACs because of the severity and sustained nature of their inflammation. In seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement is rare. However, clinical and patho-physiological features of AKC are quite different from other allergic conjunctivitis.  AKC like vernal keratoconjunctivitis, is a severe inflammatory disease, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment. The highest incidence of visual loss is therefore, found in AKC, the most chronic of these disorders.Chronic allergic conjunctivitis characteristically involves an Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated type I hypersensitivity response, manifested by papillary conjunctivitis, with itching as a universal early symptom. Hypersensitivity reactions associated with type I and a prominent T-cell mediated type IV response, along with variety of other inflammatory cell types and cytokines, contribute to the inflammatory changes of conjunctiva and cornea seen in AKC.AKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively, while SAC and PAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis.AKC tends to be chronic and unremitting, with a relatively low expectation of eventual resolution, and is associated with significant ocular morbidity. VKC is more frequently seasonal, and is generally worse in the spring season. AKC tends to be perennial and is often worse in winter. Patients are sensitive to a wide range of airborne environmental allergens.'),
(33,'what is Avian influenza in humans?','Avian influenza (AI) is an infectious viral disease of birds, commonly known as bird flu. Wild water fowl such as ducks and geese are mostly affected by AI, but often show no apparent signs of illness. Poultry birds are also susceptible to AI infection that can cause large outbreaks and epidemics in poultry.Humans are not usually affected by AI virus, however some subtypes of AI such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), have caused serious infections in people. Other avian influenza subtypes, including H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2, have also infected people.Avian influenza A(H5N1) subtype virus is highly pathogenic virus. It was first recognized in   humans in 1997 during the poultry outbreak in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China. Since its re-emergence in 2003, outbreaks of A (H5N1) have reported from poultry in Asia to Europe, and Africa. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 16 countries have reported 846 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, including 449 deaths since 2003 through 20 January 2016.Out of 16 countries, 4 were in South-East Asia Region; Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand.10 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A (H5N6) virus including 6 deaths have been detected in China since 2013.In March 2013, a subtype of influenza virus, A(H7N9) was detected first time in humans in China. A total of 722 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including at least 286 deaths , have been reported to WHO.A total of 28 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses, with mild symptoms have been detected globally.Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India has reported 25 episodes of AI A(H5N1) in poultry birds in 15 states/ union territory(Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal , Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, Sikkim, Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala, Chandigarh) till January 2015. First outbreak of H5N1 occurred in Maharashtra and Gujarat in February 2006. During 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were detected in crows in several states of India.No case of avian influenza in humans is detected in India so far. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme working under National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi is keeping surveillance of avian influenza in India.Infection of avian populations with certain subtypes of avian influenza A virus poses continuing global public health risks because of two reasons, first- occurrence of sporadic human infections and second-  emergence of a pandemic influenza strain (disease occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population).All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are reportable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005).'),
(34,'what is Astigmatism?','Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in different meridian. As a result, the light rays entering the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines.As described by Bannon and Walsh (1945), astigmatism was first mentioned in 1727 by Sir Issac Newton. But Thomas Young in 1800 published first description of astigmatism.Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.Emmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.The term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.Prevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers. Astigmatism change relatively little with age. The majority of children and young adults have a small amount of with-the-rule astigmatism, but in later adult years, there is a tendency for with-the-rule astigmatism to decrease in amount and for against-the-rule astigmatism to increase.Astigmatism is divided as Regular astigmatism: It is correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. It may be With-the-rule astigmatism: When the steepest corneal meridian is close to 90?.Against-the-rule astigmatism: When the steepest meridian is close to 180?.Oblique astigmatism: Principal meridians do not lie close to 90? or 180?.Bi- oblique astigmatism: The two principal meridians are not at right angle to each other.Irregular astigmatism: It is not correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. Patients with irregular astigmatism typically suffer from reduced visual acuity and poor quality of vision. Irregular astigmatism may result from corneal diseases, such as keratoconus, trauma or scarring following herpes infection. It may also be produced due to cataract surgery, penetrating keratoplasty or elective kerato-refractive surgery.Depending on spherical ametropia of a particular eye, astigmatism may be classified as simple or compound based on whether one or both meridians, respectively, are focused outside the retina. If one meridian focuses in front of the retina and the other meridian focuses behind it, the astigmatism is called mixed astigmatism.In astigmatism, the eye has different refractive powers along different meridians. Light entering in vertical direction gets focused differently than light in the horizontal direction. The meridian of steeper curvature has greater refractive power. The astigmatic eye produces a blurred image because two focal lines of images are being produced. This requires different corrections along each of these meridians to produce a single focused image on the retina.'),
(35,'what is Aphakia?','Aphakia is a condition in which crystalline lens of the eye is not present in its normal position of pupillary area. Either there is no crystalline lens inside the eye or the lens is subluxated or luxated. This induces a refractive state which is not a refractive error in true sense. An emmetropic (normal refraction) eye or one having low grade ametropia (refractive error) becomes extremely hypermetropic after cataract surgery. A previously emmetropic eye requires a correction of about 10 to 11 dioptres (D) in spectacle when worn in the usual position.Replacement of the crystalline lens with a spectacle lens causes the image on patient’s retina to be roughly 25% larger than the image formed with the crystalline lens. The exact magnification is determined by the power of the aphakic spectacles. There is about 2 % of magnification for each dioptre of power in the spectacles.Aphakia comes from two Greek words (a means none and phacos means lens). It refers to both an anatomical and an optical condition.Von Helmholtz (1855) worked on the optics of aphakia. Benito Daza De Valdes (1623) suggested that aphakia may be corrected with spectacles.'),
(36,'what is Anisometropia?','Anisometropia is an optical state with unequal refraction of the two eyes. The amount of spherical refractive error (myopia or hypermetropia) is usually about the same for both the eyes in most of the people. Generally, anisometropia is considered to exist if the refraction differs by 1.0 dioptres (D) or more for the two eyes. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Anisometropia is the most insidious refractive condition because it is often asymptomatic. The term antimetropia is used when one eye is myopic and the other is hypermetropic.The word anisometropia is derived from the Greek words anisos (unequal), metron (measure), and ops (vision).Emmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays.The term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near-sightedness), hypermetropia (far-sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).Anisometropia due to refractive myopia or hypermetropia is known as refractive anisometropia and that due to axial ametropia is known as axial anisometropia. Anisometropia due to difference in refractive error along one meridian only is called meridional anisometropia.In myopic anisometropia, one expects the distance visual acuity in each eye to be lower than normal, the more myopic eye having the poorer visual acuity. However, when the amount of myopia in the less myopic eye is small (minus 0.25 or 0.50 D), the visual acuity in that eye is sufficiently good so that the patient may not be aware of the problem, even if the visual acuity in the more myopic eye is quite poor.hypermetropic anisometropia, the visual acuity of both eyes is relatively good as long as the patient has sufficient accommodation.myopic anisometropia, hypermetropic anisometropia and antimetropia, the individual may not have complaint of asthenopia (eyestrain) and the anisometropia may be discovered during routine eye examination only. However, some cases of hypermetropic anisometropia may have asthenopia due to their inability to focus simultaneously.Because both the eyes accommodate equally, an uncorrected anisometrope has the problem of never having sharply focused image on both retinas at the same time. For example, a person with 0.25 D of myopia in one eye and 3 D of myopia in other eye will have a sharp focus for one eye for objects at a distance of 4 meters and a sharp focus for the other eye for objects at a distance of 33 cm. Due to this, the person uses less myopic eye for distance vision and the more myopic eye for near vision. Although stereopsis (binocular depth perception) is poor, such individuals have an advantage in later years because bifocal reading glasses may not be required.On the other hand, a person having 0.25 D of hypermetropia in one eye and 3 D of hypermetropia in the other eye has more severe difficulty. The less hypermetropic eye is used for distance vision requiring 0.25 D of accommodation only. However, more hypermetropic eye requires 3 D of accommodation for distance and 5.50 D of accommodation for a reading distance of 40 cm. Therefore, less hypermetropic eye never has a sharply focused image. It may lead to anisometropic amblyopia (non correctable visual acuity without an obvious cause) in early life.'),
(37,'what is Aniseikonia?','Aniseikonia is defined as a difference in the shape and/or size of images presented to the visual cortex by two eyes. The brain is unable to fuse two images, resulting in an extra ghost image or diplopia. Aniseikonia is often produced due to significant amount of anisometropia, especially when it is corrected by spectacles instead of contact lenses.  It is difficult to detect aniseikonia based on history and clinical examination. Aniseikonia precludes fusion of images when the degree is large. Despite this, it is rare that a patient volunteer a difference in image size and/or shape between the two eyes. Aniseikonia is usually considered clinically significant when the image size difference is greater than 4 percent, but many patients experience distortions in spatial perception and/or uncomfortable binocular vision with differences as small as 2 percent.The term ‘aniseikonia’ was introduced by Lancaster in 1938 to refer to a difference between two eyes in the perceived size of an object. The word aniseikonia originates from the Greek words aniso (unequal) and eikon (image).Emmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays.The term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near-sightedness), hypermetropia (far-sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).Optical aniseikonia denotes aniseikonia due to a physically measured difference in the sizes of the retinal images that typically arises in uncorrected axial anisometropia or in corrected refractive anisometropia. Little if any difference in the size of the image occurs with corrected axial anisometropia or with uncorrected refractive anisometropia. Aniseikonia may occur in people for whom the images in the two eyes are equal in size, in which case it must be due to non-optical causes. This condition is referred as neural aniseikonia.Aniseikonia is the cause of curable ocular discomfort suffered by small but not insignificant number of people.Most commonly aniseikonia occur following eye surgery. An eye with significant refractive error as in aphakia (when operated for cataract) or refractive surgery, the refractive error is minimised in operated eye. But the other eye still requires a strong corrective lens for clear vision. Similarly, when both eyes are operated for cataract surgery but intraocular lens (IOL) with wrong power (pseudophakia) is used in one or both eyes, also produces aniseikonia.'),
(38,'what is Asbestos-related diseases?','Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring fibrous minerals which are commercially used for insulation in buildings and as an ingredient in a number of products such as roofing tiles, water supply lines, and fire blankets, as well as clutches and brake linings, gaskets, and pads for automobiles. Asbestos causes cancer and chronic respiratory diseases in humans.All forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite) are in use because of their extraordinary tensile strength, poor heat conduction, and relative resistance to chemical attack. Chemically, asbestos minerals are silicate compounds, meaning they contain atoms of silicon and oxygen in their molecular structure.All forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to asbestos (including chrysotile) causes cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovaries, and also mesothelioma (a cancer of the pleural and peritoneal linings). Asbestos exposure is also responsible for other diseases such as asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), and plaques, thickening and effusion in the pleura.Exposure to asbestos occurs through inhalation of fibers in air in the working environment, ambient air in the vicinity of point sources such as factories handling asbestos, or indoor air in housing and buildings containing friable asbestos materials.According to World Health Organization estimates about 125 million people in the world are exposed to asbestos at the workplace. At least 107000 people die each year from asbestos-related lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis resulting from occupational exposures. Approximately half of the deaths from occupational cancer are estimated to be caused by asbestos. In addition, it is estimated that several thousand deaths annually can be attributed to exposure to asbestos in the home.It has also been shown that co-exposure to tobacco smoke and asbestos fibers substantially increases the risk for lung cancer and the heavier the smoking, the greater the risk.Asbestos is still widely used in Asian countries. Asbestos deposits are found in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Rajasthan. In India, the domestic consumption of asbestos is 1.25 lakh tones annually, out of which more than a 1.0 lakh tonnes is being imported. Significant occupational exposure to asbestos occurs mainly in asbestos cement factories, asbestos textile industry and asbestos mining and milling. National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH), Ahmedabad, has carried out environmental and epidemiological studies in cement factories, asbestos textile industry and asbestos mining and milling with the following observations. The prevalence of asbestosis in four cement factories (Ahmadabad, Hyderabad, Coimbatore and Mumbai) varied from 3% to 5%.In asbestos textile industry prevalence of asbestosis was 9% in workers having less than 10 years exposure, in contrast to the reported average duration of over 20 years. Exposure to asbestos fibers is quite high in these industries (216-418 fibers/ml as compare to permissible limit of 2 fibers /ml).The overall prevalence of asbestosis in mining and milling units was 3% and 21% respectively. In asbestos mines at two locations, the air borne fiber levels were within permissible limits. The average fiber levels in milling units were between 45 fibers/ml -244 fibers/ml.The burden of asbestos-related diseases is still rising, even in countries that banned the use of asbestos in the early 1990s. Because of the long latency periods attached to the asbestos related diseases, stopping the use of asbestos now will result in a decrease in the number of asbestos-related deaths only after a number of decades. There is no safe use of asbestos and no safe limits set by WHO, ILO (International labour organization).'),
(39,'what is Amblyopia?','Amblyopia is often defined as a difference in visual acuity of two lines or more on Snellen or equivalent chart in a child with, otherwise, healthy eyes. Amblyopia may be present any time visual acuity is reduced, and the reduction of acuity cannot be explained by findings on clinical examination, even if the difference is even one line only.The term amblyopia is derived from Greek word (amblys means dull and ops means eye), which literally means dullness of vision. Von Noorden defined amblyopia as a ‘decrease of visual acuity in one eye when caused by abnormal binocular interaction or occurring in one or both eyes as a result of patterned vision deprivation during immaturity, for which no cause can be detected during the physical examination of the eye(s) at which in appropriate cases is reversible by therapeutic measures’.Amblyopia is a functional reduction in the visual acuity of an eye caused by disuse during critical period of visual development. The mechanism of vision loss is not known, but it is thought to originate in the visual cortex. Amblyopia results in reduced visual acuity, binocularity, depth perception, and contrast sensitivity. Fusion and stereopsis, the central formation of three dimensional images, are dependent upon receiving clear images from each eye simultaneously.'),
(40,'what is Ankyloblepharon?','Ankyloblepharon is defined as adhesion of the edges of upper eyelid with the lower eyelid. The eyelids maintain their integrity and identity. The condition is usually congenital but may be acquired. In congenital ankyloblepharon, the fused eyelids fail to separate completely during development of embryo. Congenital ankyloblepharon is caused by developmental arrest leading to aberration in growth at either medial or lateral canthus. It may occur as a sporadic finding or in association with chromosomal/syndromic conditions.Ankyloblepharon may be complete, partial, or interrupted. In interrupted form, known as ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum (AFA), epithelial bands are present between the lower and upper eyelids. These fine extensile cords attaching lower and upper eyelids may be single or multiple. The cords decrease the palpebral fissure height and reduce excursion of eyelids. It is reported in trisomy 18. In autosomal dominant Hay-Well’s syndrome, ankyloblepharon may be associated with ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate. In partial ankyloblepharon, the horizontal palpebral fissure is shortened.Ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum is a form first described by Von Hasner in the year 1881.Ankyloblepharon may also develop following chemical injuries to the eyes.Trauma.Cicatrising diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or cicatricial ocular pemphigoid.Inflammatory diseases such as herpes simplex infection or ulcerative blepharitis'),
(41,'what is Abnormal uterine bleeding','Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common problem among (non-pregnant) women in the reproductive age. Formerly, it was known as dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). AUB is responsible for significant health problem and social embarrassment and it is one of the common reasons women seek health care. It has a significant impact on the quality of life for the women. Women with abnormal bleeding have a lower quality of life than the general female population.The normal length of the menstrual cycle is normally between 24 days and 38days. A normal menstrual period generally lasts up to 8days. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is bleeding from the uterus that is longer than usual or that occurs at an irregular time. (Bleeding during pregnancy has different causes).AUB leads to loss of productivity and may result in surgical interventions. AUB is reported to occur in 9 to 14% women between menarche and menopause. The prevalence varies in each country. In India, the reported prevalence of AUB is around 17.9%.The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Menstrual Disorders Working Group has proposed to abandon the use of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), while continue to use the terms abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). HMB includes menometrorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding during menstrual periods and at irregular intervals), metrorrhagia (bleeding at irregular intervals) and polymenorrhoea (more frequent periods). HMB is defined as “excessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with the womans physical, emotional, social and material quality of life, and which can occur alone, or in combination with other symptoms.To standardize nomenclature of AUB, a new system known by the acronym PLAM-COEIN, was introduced in 2011 by FIGO. The PALM-COEIN system is based on etiology and pathology of disorder, where PALM describing structural causes(polyp; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; malignancy and hyperplasia) and COEIN denoting non- structural causes of AUB (coagulopathy; ovulatory disorders; endometrial factors; iatrogenic; and not classified).Abnormal uterine bleeding in women of reproductive age is a manifestation of any of a number of pathologic disorders.'),
(42,'what is Acquired Capillary Haemangioma of Eyelid ','Acquired Capillary Haemangioma of Eyelid (Cherry haemangioma, senile haemangioma) is a common skin lesion in middle aged and older patients. Virtually, it occurs in all adults at one time or the other. The lesions may be small and may be ignored. The number of haemangiomas varies from one to two in children to even up to hundred in some elderly patients. Most commonly it affects chest or extremities, but can occasionally affect eyelids and periocular area. It varies in size from being barely visible to a dome shaped bright red swellings about 5 mm in diameter.Histologically, acquired haemangioma is identical to infantile capillary haemangioma.Haemangiomas are managed by observation over time for any increase in size or are surgically removed for cosmetic reasons.'),
(43,'what is Anaemia during pregnancy (Maternal anemia)','Anaemia during pregnancy is one of the important factors associated with a number of maternal and foetal complications. It decreases the woman’s reserve to tolerate bleeding either during or after child birth and makes prone to infections. Anaemia during pregnancy also has been associated with increased risk of intra uterine growth restriction, premature delivery, low birth weight (LBW) and maternal and child mortality.World Health Organization (WHO)/World Health Statistics data shows that 40.1% of pregnant women worldwide were anemic in 2016.  The condition is prominent in Southeast Asian countries where about half of all global maternal deaths are due to anemia and India contributes to about 80% of the maternal death due to anaemia in South Asia. There is marginally decrease in prevalence of anemia in pregnant women in India from 58% in NFHS-3 (National Family Health Survey-2005-06) to 50 % in NFHS-4 survey (2015-16).Among the various causes of anaemia in women, iron deficiency is the most common cause, primarily due to their recurrent menstrual loss and secondary due to poor supply of iron in the diet. During pregnancy anemia is common due to increased demand of iron for the growing fetus and placenta; and increased red blood cell mass (with expanded maternal blood volume in the third trimester), which is further aggravated with other factors such as childbearing at an early age, repeated pregnancies, short intervals between pregnancies and poor access to antenatal care and supplementation. Indian Council of Medical Research considers haemoglobin (Hb) level below 10.9 g/dl as cutoff point for anemia during pregnancy.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has given emphasis to prevent anaemia under RMNCH+A services. National Health Policy 2017 also addressed malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies interventions. “National Iron Plus Initiative” launched in 2013 is a comprehensive strategy to combat the public health challenge of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) prevalent across the life cycle.National Nutrition Mission has been setup under the oversight of the Ministry of Women and Child Development with the aim to reduce anaemia among young children, adolescent girls and women of reproductive age (15–49 years) by one third of NFHS-4 levels by 2022.'),
(44,'what is Antepartum hemorrhage (Bleeding in late pregnancy)?','Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract, occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby. APH complicates 3–5% of pregnancies; and is a leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality worldwide.The causes of APH include: placenta praevia, placental abruption and local causes (such as bleeding from the vulva, vagina or cervix). Placenta previa & placental abruption constitute 50% of APH.'),
(45,'what is Acute encephalitis syndrome?','Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a serious public health problem in India. It is characterized as acute-onset of fever and a change in mental status (mental confusion, disorientation, delirium, or coma) and/or new-onset of seizures in a person of any age at any time of the year. The disease most commonly affects children and young adults and can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality.Viruses are the main causative agents in AES cases, although other sources such as bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals, toxins and noninfectious agents have also been reported over the past few decades.Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the major cause of AES in India (ranging from 5%-35%).Herpes simplex virus, Influenza A virus, West Nile virus, Chandipura virus, mumps, measles, dengue, Parvovirus B4, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus and scrub typhus, S.pneumoniae are the other causes of AES in sporadic and outbreak form in India. Nipah virus, Zika virus are also found as causative agents for AES. The etiology in a large number of AES cases still remains unidentified.AES due to JEV was clinically diagnosed in India for the first time in 1955 in the southern State of Madras, now Tamil Nadu. During 2018, 10485 AES cases and 632 deaths were reported from 17 states to the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP)*in India, with a case fatality rate around 6 per cent. AES cases were reported mainly from Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh'),
(46,'what is Amaurosis Fugax or transient monocular blindness (TMB) ','Amaurosis Fugax or transient monocular blindness (TMB) refers to transient brief blindness, blurring, fogging, or dimming of vision, varying in duration from few seconds to minutes or even hours in some cases. The duration of visual impairment is brief usually less than fifteen minutes and rarely exceeding thirty minutes. The term Amaurosis fugax has been used not only for monocular condition, but also for the transient loss of vision in both eyes (less common). Most of the patients are affected for about one to five minutes only. Generally, recovery is in the same pattern as the visual loss, although usually more gradual. Amaurosis is also known as blackout.It is thought to occur from transient occlusion of the ophthalmic circulation and is a risk factor for acute stroke. Fundus examination is commonly normal but may show prior retinal arterial emboli or attenuation of arteries. Investigations like carotid ultrasonography and cardiac echography may help in finding source of embolus.It is produced by ocular vascular occlusive disorders such as Central retinal artery (CRA) occlusion Central retinal vein (CRV) occlusion CRV occlusion with cilioretinal artery occlusion Branch retinal arteriole occlusion Branch retinal vein occlusion Ocular ischaemic syndrome (OIS)Arteritic and non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION) It may also be seen in giant cell arteritis.Detailed history of Amaurosis attack and the duration of visual disturbance helps in classification of visual loss occurrence into following four types Type I: It is due to transient retinal ischaemia Type II: It is due to retinal vascular insufficiency Type III: It occurs due to vasospasm Type IV: It occurs in association with antiphospholipid antibodies but also include cases due to unknown causes.'),
(47,'what is Abducens (or Abducent) nerve Palsy or Cranial nerve six palsy (CN VI)','Abducens (or Abducent) nerve Palsy or Cranial nerve six palsy (CN VI) is a common neuro-ophthalmic disorder. Since CN VI has a long intracranial course, it may be affected by multiple aetiologies. It may be unilateral or bilateral condition.CN VI is a pure motor nerve that innervates ipsilateral (same side) lateral rectus muscle of the eye and controls abduction (outward movement) of the eyeball. This nerve has the longest intracranial course amongst all the cranial nerves. A palsy affecting this nerve alone is less common. Usually, seventh (CN VII or facial) and eighth (CN VIII or vestibulocochlear) cranial nerves are also affected along with it, which signals a central cause.Children are more likely to be affected by a tumour, and older people are more likely to have vasculopathy producing ischaemia.CN VI palsy may present with ‘false localising sign’, suggesting impingement, when in fact, the causative reason/tumour may be remotely present, or there may not be any detectable reason/tumour. Similarly, raised intracranial pressure may stretch CN VI, and perhaps compression of its vascular supply.The sixth cranial nerve is the most commonly affected motor nerve to the eye in adults.'),
(48,'what is Zika virus disease?','Zika virus disease is an emerging mosquito borne viral disease. It is transmitted by bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Zika virus was first identified in Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys. In1952, it was identified in humans, in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania through serological tests. The virus was isolated from human samples in Nigeria in 1968. Outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.In 2007, the South Pacific recorded its first outbreak of Zika virus in Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. In October 2013, French Polynesia reported its first outbreak.In May 2015, the public health authorities of Brazil confirmed the transmission of Zika virus in the northeast of the country. Since October 2015, other countries and territories of the Americas have reported the presence of the virus.Along with Zika virus infection, cluster of microcephaly (condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth) cases and other neurological disorders (Guillain-Barré Syndrome) (GBS) reported in Brazil and a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014.World Health Organisation (WHO) strongly suspected a causal relationship between zika virus infection during pregnancy and microcephaly and recommended more investigation and research to understand any possible link. No scientific evidence to date confirms a link between Zika Virus and microcephaly or GBS.On 1st February 2016, WHO announced that the cluster of neurological disorders and neonatal malformations reported in the Americas region constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.Since 2007, Zika viral transmission has been documented in 46 countries and territories including 34 countries which reported autochthonous transmission, or locally acquired infection, between 2015 and 2016, six countries with indication of viral circulation, five countries where the Zika virus outbreak has ended and one country with a locally acquired case but without vector borne transmission(12th February 2016)*.'),
(49,'what is Yellow Fever?','Yellow fever is a serious viral infection that is   spread by a   mosquito known as the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The causative agent is virus   of the Flavivirus genus. Yellow fever mainly occurs in sub-Saharan Africa (countries to the south of the Sahara desert), South America and in parts of the Caribbean.There are two forms of yellow fever: Urban and Jungle. Clinically and etiologically they are identical.Urban yellow fever is an epidemic viral disease of humans transmitted from infected to susceptible persons by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which breed in domestic and peri domestic containers (e.g., water jars, barrels, drums, tires, or tin cans) and thus in close association with humans. In areas where Ae. aegypti has been eliminated or suppressed, urban yellow fever has disappeared. Urban yellow fever can be prevented by vaccinating human populations at risk for infection or by suppressing populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes so that they no longer perpetuate infection.Jungle yellow fever can most effectively be prevented by vaccination of human populations at risk for exposure.'),
(50,'what is Yaws?','Yaws is a chronic contagious non-venereal disease, belongs to a group of chronic bacterial infections (endemic treponematoses, nonvenereal spirochetal diseases) caused by treponemes. (Other diseases belonging to this group are bejel (endemic syphilis) and pinta). Yaws is the most common of all and occurs primarily in the warm, humid and tropical areas of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Indian peninsula and the equatorial islands of South-East Asia.Yaws is caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Yaws is not a fatal disease, but causes disabilities and visible deformities of the face and extremities contributing to stigma and discrimination. It affects the skin, bone and cartilage; if left untreated it can lead to deformities of the nose and bones of the leg. However, the disease can be cured and prevented by a single dose of antibiotics.In India cases were first reported among tea plantation labourers in Assam in1887. Later on cases occurred in Orissa, Chattishgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other areas.In India the disease is mostly known by the name of the tribes affected most in any region. Thus for example, the disease is called ‘Madia Roga’ and ‘Gondi Roga’ in Bastar area of Chattishgarh and Sironcha area of Maharashtra respectively and ‘Koya rogam’ in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. Some synonyms of Yaws are based on clinical features like ‘Domaru Khahu’ in Assam which indicates fig like eruption. Chakawar is a term used for chronic ulcers in Central India and part of Uttar Pradesh.The disease was reported from tribal inhabited districts in states of Chattishgarh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Cases of Yaws were also reported from Madhya Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Assam, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.The disease has been eliminated from India in 2006 as no new yaws case has been reported after 2003 in the country. It has long been considered by World Health Organization (WHO) that Yaws can be eradicated because humans are the only reservoir.Eradication of Yaws in India is possible because man is the only reservoir of infection; a single injection of long acting penicillin was effective; infection was localised to small pockets and; no case has been reported after 2003.'),
(51,'what is Xanthelasma','Xanthelasma (xanthelasma palpebrarum) is a raised, yellow, soft, plaque-like, velvety lesion most commonly seen in the medial canthal (inner junction between upper and lower eyelid) area of the eyelid. It is a common subcutaneous eyelid lesion. It tends to be bilateral and is more common in the elderly. It has slightly more female preponderance. Xanthelasma is known to occur as a result of hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolemia, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Although some patients with xanthelasma have normal lipid levels, others may show hyperlipidaemia (usually type II) or secondary hyperlipidaemia owing to conditions such as biliary cirrhosis or diabetes mellitus.When it is large and nodular, it may assume tumourous proportions and is then called xanthoma. Tuberous xanthoma appears as solitary or multiple, placoid or papular lesion which has predilection for elbows, knees, fingers and buttocks. Multiple eruptive xanthomas may sometimes occur in patients.Erasmus Wilson originally described xanthelasma about hundred years ago. This word is derived from the Greek Xanthos meaning ‘yellow’ and elasma, meaning ‘beaten metal plate’. Rarely these may be large enough to obstruct vision.'),
(52,'what is Xerophthalmia ?.','Xerophthalmia is a condition of early vitamin A deficiency in which cornea keratinises, become opaque and forms dry, scaly layers of cells. Affected cornea is susceptible to infection. The conjunctiva may keratinise and develop plaques known as Bitot’s spots.  In1863, Pierre Bitot, a French physician, first described these spots.The eye lesions are primarily disease of the young and are a major cause of blindness in developing countries. Although rates of xerophthalmia have fallen, the number of affected children is still high.Vitamin A deficiencyThe risk of vitamin A deficiency is small in children who are getting vitamin A (retinol) or its precursors. Deficiency states are common in many developing countries and are often associated with global malnutrition. Barring impoverished populations, deficiency of vitamin A is rare in developed countries. Vitamin A deficiency may also be seen as a complication with various chronic disorders or diseases in children. Medical history related to dietary habits may be important in identifying nutritional disorders.In eye, vitamin A is metabolised to form rhodopsin (retinal visual pigment). Action of light on rhodopsin is the initial step in the visual process.Pre-formed vitamin A is available in foods of animal origin only. Vitamin A may be obtained from carotenes, which are present in green and coloured vegetables and yellow fruits. Carotenes provide vitamin A to the vegetarians.Malnutrition, especially protein deficiency, may also cause vitamin A deficiency. Clinical or sub-clinical zinc deficiency may also increase the risk of vitamin A deficiency.Except for vitamin A, toxicity from excess intake of vitamins is less common. Excessive intake of carotene (precursor of vitamin A) may lead to pigmentation of skin (hypercarotenosis). This gets reduced and fades away when intake of carotene is reduced.'),
(53,'what is Whooping Cough(Pertussis)','Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs. It is also known as pertussis. Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After fits of many coughs, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breathes which result in a \"whooping\" sound. Pertussis most commonly affects infants and young children and can be fatal, especially in babies less than 1 year of age.'),
(54,'what is West Nile fever?','West Nile fever is a zoonotic disease (an animal disease affecting humans). Disease is caused by West Nile virus (WNV), which is a flavivirus related to the viruses that cause St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever. West Nile virus is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. WNV is maintained in nature by transmission between birds and mosquitoes; as birds are the natural hosts of the virus. Humans, horses and other mammals can be infected.West Nile fever can cause severe neurological illness and death in people, however about 80% of people who are infected show no symptoms.West Nile virus was first isolated in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. An epidemic of West Nile fever was reported in humans in Israel in 1951. In 1999 WNV was imported in New York and produced a large outbreak that spread throughout the continental United States of America (USA) during 1999-2010. Large outbreaks also occurred in Greece, Israel, Romania and Russia. The virus is now widely reported from Canada to Venezuela. Outbreak sites are on major birds’ migratory routes. WNV is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia.WNV is highly prevalent in India. Infection usually presents as a mild, non-fatal dengue like illness in humans. Febrile illness and encephalitis cases in epidemic form were observed in Udaipur district of Rajasthan, Buldhana, Marathwada and Khandesh districts of Maharashtra. Human sera collected from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Rajasthan showed presence of WNV neutralizing antibodies. Serologically confirmed cases of WNV infections were reported from Vellore and Kolar districts during 1977, 1978 and 1981.Presence of WNV was documented in north- eastern region of India during the year 2006 from four districts (Japanese encephalitis (JE) endemic areas) of Assam; in which11.6% of serum samples of AES (acute encephalitis syndrome) cases were found positive for IgM against WNV (these samples were negative for IgM against JE virus).During an outbreak of AES in Kerala, in May 2011, presence of WNV was confirmed in clinical specimens. Since then, WNV encephalitis cases have regularly been reported in Kerala.'),
(55,'what is Welding-arc maculopathy?','Welding-arc maculopathy may develop following prolonged exposure to welding arc radiation without adequate protection of eyes. It generally affects young people because of their occupational lack of knowledge and also due to presence of relatively clear ocular media. Most common injury with welding arc radiation is photophthalmia due to ultraviolet (UV) light absorption. Welding-arc maculopathy may be underreported because of its transient clinical features, which may be masked by associated photokeratitis.The effect of light on retina is being recognised since the time of Plato, who gave description of eclipse blindness.Photic (related to light) retinopathy is a generalised term used for retinal damage produced by light. This may be due to solar viewing or may be produced even by use of operating microscope.Increase in retinal temperature is below photocoagulation thresholds. The injury is due to photochemical effects from UV and short blue wavelength exposure. Similar photochemical macular burns may take place after brief exposure to the flash associated with short-circuiting of a high-tension electric current. Use of drug phenothiazine may increase the susceptibility to damage due to the welding-arc radiation.In metal-arc inert gas welding, the arc is ensheathed with inert gas to prevent oxidation of molten metal. The gas changes emitted radiation into visible and infra-red range, which may produce thermal and photochemical damage to the retina. This is unlike electric arc where the radiation is predominantly in UV range.The appearance of retinal lesions and clinical course of welding arc exposure are similar to those of solar retinopathy. However, welding-arc maculopathy requires more prolonged exposure as compared to solar retinopathy.'),
(61,'What is (are) Blindness ?','Visual impairment is when a person has sight loss that cannot be fully corrected using glasses or contact lenses.Blindness as defined by national programme for control of blindness (NPCB) under following headings:Inability of a person to count fingers from a distance of 6 meters or 20 feet (technical definition)Vision 6/60 or less with the best possible spectacle correction Diminution of field vision to 20 feet or less in better eye There are two main categories of visual impairment: Being partially sighted or sight impaired – where the level of sight loss is moderate Severe sight impairment (blindness) – where the level of sight loss is so severe that activities that rely on eyesight become impossible.Types of Blindness:Economic blindness: Inability of a person to count fingers from a distance of 6 meters or 20 feet technical Definition Social blindness: Vision 3/60 or diminution of field of vision to 10° Manifest blindness: Vision 1/60 to just perception of light Absolute blindness: No perception of light        Curable blindness: That stage of blindness where the damage is reversible by prompt management e.g. cataract Preventable blindness: The loss of blindness that could have been completely prevented by institution of effective preventive or prophylactic measures e.g. xerophthalmia, trachoma and glaucoma Avoidable blindness: The sum total of preventable or curable blindness is often referred to as avoidable blindness.'),
(62,'What is (are) Breast Cancer / Carcinoma ?','Cancer that forms in tissues of the breast is usually the ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) and lobules (glands that make milk). It occurs in both men and women, although male breast cancer is rare. Breast cancer is the top cancer in women both in the developed and the developing world.There are various forms of cancers like:Ductal Carcinomas: Cancer originating from ducts.Lobular carcinomas: Cancer originating from lobules.'),

It can occur at any age.Chronic bronchitis a type of COPD, which involves a cough that produces sputum for 3 months for 2 consecutive years.'),
(64,'What is (are) Brucellosis ?','Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease (any disease or infection that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans and vice-versa is classified as a zoonotic disease).It is also known as “undulant fever”, “Mediterranean fever” or “Malta fever” .  Brucellosis is a disease of mainly cattle, swine, goats, sheep and dogs.The infection is transmitted to humans by animals through direct contact with infected materials like afterbirth or indirectly by ingestion of animal products and by inhalation of airborne agents.Consumption of raw milk and cheese made from raw milk (fresh cheese) is the major source of infection in man. It is also an occupational disease for people who work in the livestock sector.It affects people of all age groups and of both sexes.'),
(65,'What is (are) Bedsores ?','Bedsores are also called pressure sores or pressure ulcers .Bedsores are injuries to skin and underlying tissues resulting from prolonged pressure on the skin.Bedsores generally develop on skin that covers bony areas of the body, such as heels, ankles, hips or buttocks.Most people at risk of bedsores are those with a medical condition, that limits their ability to change position, requires them to use a wheelchair or confines them to bed for prolonged periods.Bedsores can develop quickly and are often difficult to treat.Several care strategies can help prevent some bedsores and promote healing.'),
(66,'What is (are) Back Pain ?','Acute or short term back pain lasts for few days to few weeks.It usually feels like an ache, strain or rigidity in the back.Chronic back pain persists for more than 3 weeks.The pain is generally triggered by improper posture while sitting or standing, bending awkwardly, or lifting incorrectly.Back pain is not generally caused by a serious condition and, in most cases, it gets better within 1-2 weeks.It can be treated by taking painkillers.'),
(67,'What is (are) Bells Palsy ?','Bells palsy is a form of facial paralysis resulting from a dysfunction of the cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve) causing temporary weakness of the muscles on one side of the face.Symptoms vary from person to person.It is of following types:Partial palsy: That is mild muscle weakness Complete palsy: There is no movement  at all (though very rare)'),
(68,'What is (are) Brain Tumour ?','Brain tumour is an abnormal or uncontrolled growth of cells found in the brain. In a healthy human body, normal cells grow old or die and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. Some unnecessary new cells are produced when the body doesnt need them, and old or damaged cells dont die as they should. The formation of these extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumour. There are two main types of tumours which are called benign tumours (harmless growth) and malignant (cancerous tumours). Brain tumour is a deadly disease. However, it can be treated by various methods but majority of patients die within 9-12 months and less than 3% survive more than 3 years.Cancerous tumours can be divided into primary brain tumours that start within the brain, and secondary brain tumours that originate from somewhere else, but spread throughout the body, known as brain metastasis tumours.There are many types of primary brain tumours. They are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they are found or begin. For example, if the brain tumour begins in glial cells it is called glioma. Similarly there are other types depending upon the part of brain in which the tumour originates.'),
(69,'What is (are) Benign Essential Blepharospasm ?','Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is an idiopathic disorder of progressive involuntary spasms of orbicularis oculi and upper facial muscles leading to closure of eyelids. BEB is a bilateral condition and a form of focal dystonia (repetitive involuntary sustained muscle contraction) characterised by episodic contraction of protractor (drawing a part forward) muscles (orbicularis oculi, procerus and corrugator superciliaris) and is not associated with another disease. Severe blepharospasm may temporarily make patient functionally blind. Blepharospasm may be precipitated by factors such as reading, bright light, driving or stress and alleviated by talking, relaxation or walking.BEB should be differentiated from blepharospasm that can exist as part of specific condition (secondary blepharospasm) such as:-Meige’s syndrome: Meige’s syndrome is characterised by blepharospasm with involvement of the lower facial and neck muscles.Breughel’s syndrome: Breughel’s syndrome (oromandibular dystonia) is association of blepharospasm with severe mandibular and cervical muscle involvement.Extrapyramidal disorders: Systemic disease such as extrapyramidal disorders may be present with blepharospasm.Reflex blepharospasm: Reflex blepharospasm may be secondary to irritation of ocular surface.'),
(70,'What is (are) Blepharitis ?','Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margins. It is a common disorder affecting external eye, the cause for which is unclear, although seborrhoea and staphylococcal infection play important roles.Chronic blepharitis may cause secondary changes in the cornea and conjunctiva, and many patients have associated tear film instability. This condition may interfere with contact lens wear and aggravate treatment of dry eyes.While generally not sight- threatening, it may permanently damage eyelid margin.Blepharitis may be divided into:Anterior blepharitis:Anterior blepharitis affects eyelid skin, root of eyelashes and eyelash follicles. It is divided into:--       Staphylococcal blepharitis.-       Seborrhoeic blepharitis.Seborrhoeic blepharitis is more common in older age group. Staphylococcal blepharitis tends to affect younger patients as compared to seborrhoeic blepharitis and may start in childhood.Posterior blepharitis:Posterior blepharitis affects meibomian glands and their orifices. It has a range of potential causes, the primary cause being meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). There are three main types:--       Meibomian seborrhoea.-       Primary meibomitis.-       Meibomitis with secondary blepharitis.Frequently, there is considerable overlap of these in an individual patient. Seborrhoeic blepharitis may occur in isolation or it may be associated with anterior staphylococcal blepharitis or even posterior blepharitis.Since bacteria and inflammation are believed to contribute for the disease, long-term management may include eyelid hygiene and use of therapeutic agents which reduce infection and inflammation.'),
(71,'What is (are) Band Shaped Keratopathy ?','Band Shaped Keratopathy (Calcific band keratopathy, or band keratopathy) is a non-specific corneal condition characterised by chronic deposition of calcium salts (principally hydroxyapatite) within the basement membrane, Bowman’s layer and anterior stromal lamellae of the corneal epithelium (leaving remainder of the cornea clear). Initially, corneal degenerative changes begin near the limbus, either on nasal, temporal or both sides together in exposed palpebral fissure at 3 to 9 o’clock position. Calcific band is concentric with the limbus but is separated from it by a clear zone (representing a lucid interval) due to lack of Bowman’s layer at the periphery, or due to buffering action at the limbus. Keratopathy appears as a superficial greyish-white corneal opacity having frosted or ground glass appearance. The opacity is covered by clear epithelium with lacunae of uninvolved tissue. There are numerous holes where corneal nerves penetrate the Bowman’s layer. The disease progresses toward the corneal center and thickens as well in its anterior and posterior dimensions, resulting in more opaque, whitish surface with increased nodularity. Calcium deposits thicken and may cause breakdown of the overlying epithelium, resulting in the appearance of spontaneous and recurrent corneal epithelial erosions.'),
(72,'What is (are) Burns ?','Burns are a serious public health problem. A burn is defined as an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals.Heat burns occur when some or all of the different layers of cells in the skin are destroyed by a hot liquid (scald), a hot solid (contact burn) or a flame (flame burn). Skin injuries due to ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity or chemicals, as well as respiratory damage resulting from smoke inhalation, are also considered as burns.'),
(73,'What is (are) Blepharochalasis ?','Blepharochalasis is a rare disorder that typically affects upper lids. It is characterised by intermittent oedema of the lids, with frequent recurrence. It produces eyelid tissue relaxation and latter atrophy. It may be unilateral in some cases. In addition to recurrent attacks of oedema, it is associated with ‘cigarette-paper’ skin and subcutaneous telangiectasia.The term blepharochalasis was coined by Fuchs in1896. The term blepharochalasis is frequently misused to indicate redundant skin of the ageing eyelid, a common condition more accurately termed as dermatochalasis.The word blepharochalasis originates from the Greek word blepharon meaning eyelid and chalasis meaning relaxing.'),
(74,'What is (are) Bad Breath (Halitosis) ?','Bad breath or Halitosis (oral malodour) is an unpleasant odour of the mouth. It is a common complaint for both genders and for all age groups. Nearly more than 50% of the general population in developed countries have halitosis.Bad breath affects a persons daily life, causes social and psychological discomfort for individuals and affect their relation with other people.Mild transient bad breath which often arises after sleep is common and generally not regarded as halitosis. It is termed as “morning halitosis.”Some people complain of halitosis yet there is no measurable halitosis, even with objective testing, this may be a symptom of delusion or mono symptomatic hypochondriasis (self oral malodour). It is known as HALITOPHOBIA or PSEUDOHALITOSIS.Such people may wrongly perceive others actions as an indicator that their breath is offensive so they adopt a variety of behaviours to overcome their perceived problem like covering the mouth while talking, keeping a distance from other people, or avoiding social interactions. These patients may become fixated with teeth cleaning, tongue cleaning and frequently use mints, chewing gums, mouthwashes, and sprays to reduce their distress.'),
(75,'What is (are) Bleeding Gums ?','Bleeding from gums may occur while brushing or sometimes it occurs on its own (spontaneously). If you often see a pink tinge in the sink after brushing teeth, you have bleeding gums. It may be a sign of inflammation of gums. Inflamed gums appear red and swollen while healthy gums are light pink in colour.Most common cause of bleeding gums is accumulation of plaque on the teeth. If this plaque is not removed by regular brushing and flossing between teeth, it hardens up and turn into tartar or calculus which cannot be cleaned by regular brushing. Calculus can only be removed by professional dental cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist. If not cleaned, over the time, it will lead to inflamed gums and increased bleeding from gums which is the main sign of gingivitis.If ignored and not taken proper care of oral hygiene, it may advance to gingivitis which may progress to periodontitis (disease of gums and surrounding tissue and bone). Bleeding gums may also be a sign of a serious medical condition such as diabetes, HIV, immunosuppressive diseases, etc.'),
(76,'What is (are) Bruxism (Teeth Grinding) ?','Habitual grinding or clenching of teeth, either during sleep or as an unconscious habit during waking hours, is known as Bruxism and commonly called as “Teeth Grinding”.Pavon described bruxism as one of the most common, complex and destructive dental functional disorder (parafunctional habit). Initially, it is difficult to identify mainly as the patients themselves are unaware of it. According to Nadler, bruxism affect a large percentage of the population, including all age groups. In some individuals it may be considered as an attempt to cope with stress and anxiety.Bruxism, usually, does not have any harmful effects but when it occurs on regular basis, it causes tooth wear, occlusal trauma, temporomandibular joint problems, and hypertrophy of muscles. Correct diagnosis is necessary for its treatment.PARAFUNCTIONAL HABITS:Drum introduced the term “parafunction”. Parafunctional activities, also known as muscle hyperactivity, are non-functional, oro-mandibular or lingual activities such as  bruxism, jaw clenching, tooth tapping, cheek biting, lip biting, and object biting.These habits are different from functional activities that are controlled muscle activities such as chewing, speaking and swallowing.DEFINITIONS:American Academy of Orofacial Pain defined bruxism as “diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional activity including clenching, bracing, gnashing, and grinding of the teeth.”American Sleep Disorders Association defined bruxism as “tooth grinding or clenching during sleep plus one of the following: Tooth wear, sounds or jaw muscle discomfort in the absence of medical disorder.”Zarb and Carlsson defined bruxism as “nocturnal clenching and grinding of teeth.”Clenching: Clenching of the teeth is defined as forceful closure of the opposing dentition in a static relationship of the mandible to the maxilla in either maximum intercuspation or an eccentric position.Grinding of the dentition is defined as forceful closure of the opposing dentition in a dynamic maxillomandibular relationship as the mandibular arch moves through various excursive positions.');

Damage to anterior structures of eye is commoner than posterior segment. Posterior segment trauma is generally more visually devastating because of the involvement of optic nerve or retina.Patient presenting with ocular inflammation after airbag deployment should have their eyes irrigated with normal saline to remove any alkaline particulate foreign body.Due to increased risk and severity of airbag induced eye injuries, innovation of airbag and eyewear protection design is needed. One such innovation is the possibility of airbags that would inflate at different speeds depending upon the severity of collision, and the physical characteristics of the occupants.','Although having airbags in your car is safer than not having them, when an airbag deploys, it can damage the eye in some cases.To avoid potential injury, one expert recommends sitting back from the steering wheel and always wearing a seat belt.Newer-model cars may have airbags that deploy with less force, making them even safer for the eyes, and \"smart\" airbags will soon be available in some models as well.'),

After discharge from hospital appropriate instructions for household members on personal hygiene and infection control measures should be provided.Along with supportive therapy some antiviral drugs, especially oseltamivir, can be used. It reduces the duration of viral replication and improves prospects of survival.Antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) is given as early as possible based on clinical suspicion (ideally, within 48 hours following symptom onset) and before confirmation of causative agent. In suspected case a standard five day course should be given, unless any other diagnosis is confirmed. In a confirmed case depending on the clinical status, dose and duration of the oseltamivir therapy can be increased by treating clinician.

Depending on the severity, a variety of approaches may be used to promote healing.They include synthetic dressings, saline dressings, acetic acid compresses, and various antibiotic dressings (bedsores are particularly prone to infection).For more severe wounds, surgery may be necessary to remove areas of dead skin. The most important step in both treatment and prevention of bedsores is relieving pressure by frequent repositioning.','The best way to prevent bedsores is by changing position frequently to avoid constant pressure against body and to redistribute body weight.It also promotes  blood flow to the tissues. If one cant move, he or she should be helped to reposition at least every 2 hours, or every 15 minutes if you are seated in a chair.Pillows or foam wedges can help to shift weight if one is unable to move.Range of motion (exercise machine) exercises can help prevent contractures, improve circulation; and maintain joint integrity, mobility, and muscle mass.The  bed should not be elevated more than 30 degrees (except when you are eating)'),

(56,'Bruxism (Teeth Grinding)','There is no specific treatment that can stop Sleep Bruxism. Treatments such as habit awareness therapy, habit reversal therapy, and relaxation techniques may eliminate Awake Bruxism.If the underlying cause of Bruxism is an emotional one, the nervous factor must be corrected if the disease is to be cured.Removable splints (occlusal splints, occlusal bite guard, night guards, bite plate , can  be worn at night to immobilise the jaws or to guide the movement so that periodontal damage is minimal.Recently, Botulinum toxin (Botox) has been found to be very successful in the treatment of bruxism. When Botox is injected into the masseter muscle, it weakens the muscle enough to stop the grinding and clenching, but not so much as to interfere with chewing or facial expressions.','Identification of the problem is necessary to prevent it.If it is due to stress, focus on reducing it through relaxation, meditation, counselling etc.If it is due to a sleeping disorder; treatment of the sleeping disorder is a prerequisite.Reduce consumption of foods and drinks containing caffeine.Avoid chewing objects such as pen or pencils, pins etc.Place your tongue between your teeth, if you notice yourself clenching or grinding during the day Visit the dentist for proper diagnosis and treatment of the condition.');

(29,'Anthrax infection occurs in three forms: cutaneous, inhalation, and gastrointestinal, depending on the mode of transmission. Cutaneous anthrax accounts for most of the cases in endemic situation.Cutaneous, or skin, anthrax is the most common form. It is usually contracted when a person with a break in their skin, such as a cut or abrasion, comes into direct contact with anthrax spores. The resulting itchy bump rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people can then develop headaches, muscle aches, fever and vomiting. Cutaneous anthrax usually occurs after exposure to infected animals or their contaminated tissues and products such as hair, hides, wool, bones and skin.Gastrointestinal anthrax is caught from eating meat from an infected animal. It causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning but these can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea.Pulmonary anthrax- The most severe form of human anthrax is called inhalation or pulmonary anthrax. Though the rarest, it is the form of human anthrax causing the most current concern. This form of the disease is caused when a person is directly exposed to a large number of anthrax spores suspended in the air, and breathes them in. The first symptoms are similar to those of a common cold, but this can rapidly progress to severe breathing difficulties and shock.','21'),

Many people donot know they have the disease until they have a medical emergency, such as   heart attack or stroke.Some people may have signs and symptoms of the disease. Signs and symptoms will depend on which arteries are affected.Coronary Arteries The coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to   heart. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease called coronary heart disease, or CHD), it may lead to   angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when   heart muscle doesnot get enough oxygen-rich blood.Angina may feel like pressure or squeezing in   chest. Pain may also be felt in shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain.Other symptoms of CHD are shortness of breath and arrhythmias Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.Plaque also can form in the hearts smallest arteries. This disease is called coronary microvascular disease (MVD). Symptoms of coronary MVD include angina, shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), and lack of energy.Carotid Arteries The carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to   brain. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease called carotid artery disease), one may have symptoms of   stroke. These symptoms may include:Sudden weak Paralysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body Confusion Trouble speaking or understanding speech Trouble seeing in one or both eyes Difficulty in breathing Dizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls Loss of consciousness Sudden and severe headache Peripheral Arteries Plaque also can build up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis (a disease called peripheral artery disease).If these major arteries are narrowed or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and sometimes dangerous infections.Renal Arteries The renal arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to   kidneys. If plaque builds up in these arteries, one may develop chronic kidney disease. Over time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function.Early kidney disease often has no signs or symptoms.
